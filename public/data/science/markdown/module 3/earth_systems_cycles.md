## Earth's Systems & Cycles

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights Earth's interconnected subsystems and the cycles that sustain life. Prompt: How do Earth's major systems interact to create a stable environment for life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Earth is a complex network of interdependent systems: the geosphere (land), hydrosphere (water), atmosphere (air), and biosphere (life). These systems are in constant exchange, transferring energy and matter through cycles such as the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles. Feedback loops within and between systems regulate climate, nutrient availability, and the habitability of the planet.

### 1. The Geosphere

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Explore the solid Earth—rocks, minerals, and tectonic processes. Prompt: How does the movement of tectonic plates affect life on Earth's surface?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The geosphere includes Earth's crust and mantle, where tectonic activity reshapes continents and creates natural hazards like volcanoes and earthquakes. It provides essential resources and physical structure for ecosystems and human settlements.

### 2. The Hydrosphere

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Dive into Earth's water systems. Prompt: How do oceans, rivers, and groundwater support life and shape the climate?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The hydrosphere includes all of Earth’s water—liquid, solid, and vapor. It regulates temperature, transports nutrients, and drives weather systems. Oceans cover over 70% of Earth’s surface and act as climate buffers.

### 3. The Atmosphere

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Investigate the role of Earth’s gaseous envelope. Prompt: What functions does the atmosphere serve in protecting and sustaining life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The atmosphere provides oxygen, carbon dioxide, and insulation from the vacuum of space. It distributes solar energy, drives the water cycle, and contains greenhouse gases that regulate temperature.

### 4. The Biosphere

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Examine Earth’s living layer. Prompt: How does life influence and adapt to Earth’s physical systems?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The biosphere includes all living organisms. It interacts with the geosphere (e.g., roots breaking rock), atmosphere (e.g., oxygen-carbon exchange), and hydrosphere (e.g., aquatic ecosystems). Life both shapes and is shaped by the Earth system.

### 5. The Water Cycle

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Understand how water moves and transforms across systems. Prompt: Why is the water cycle essential for balancing ecosystems and climate?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Water circulates through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. This cycle connects oceans, land, air, and living things. It controls weather patterns and supports plant and animal life across biomes.

### 6. The Carbon Cycle

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Trace carbon’s journey through Earth's systems. Prompt: How do human actions disrupt the natural balance of the carbon cycle?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Carbon moves between atmosphere, oceans, rocks, and living things. Plants absorb CO₂; animals release it. Fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes accelerate carbon buildup, impacting climate.

### 7. The Nitrogen Cycle

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Follow the flow of nitrogen across the biosphere. Prompt: Why is nitrogen vital for life, and how is it made usable?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Nitrogen makes up most of Earth’s atmosphere, but must be “fixed” into usable compounds by lightning, bacteria, or human activity. It supports protein and DNA synthesis. Overuse of fertilizers can cause ecological imbalance.

### 8. Feedback Loops & System Interactions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
Discover how changes in one system impact others. Prompt: Can small disruptions in Earth’s systems lead to large-scale effects?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Positive feedback loops (like melting ice reducing reflectivity) and negative loops (like cloud formation moderating heat) govern Earth’s stability. Understanding these loops helps us predict and respond to environmental change.
