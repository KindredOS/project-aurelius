## What Are the Branches of Science?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the major branches of science and how they explore different aspects of the natural and social world. Prompt: What are the different branches of science, and how do they help us understand our world?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Science is organized into major disciplines, each focusing on different aspects of the natural world. Together, they provide a broad and interconnected view of how everything works.

## Interdisciplinary Science

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how scientific fields often work together. Prompt: What is an example of a problem that requires more than one branch of science to solve?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Real-world challenges—like climate change or disease prevention—often require collaboration between different branches of science. Interdisciplinary science brings together tools and knowledge from multiple fields.
