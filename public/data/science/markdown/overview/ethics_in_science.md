## Avoiding Bias

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how scientists try to prevent personal beliefs from affecting their work. Prompt: What are some ways scientists can reduce bias in their experiments?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Bias can affect how data is collected, interpreted, or shared. Using blind testing, peer review, and transparent methods helps reduce its influence.

## Reproducibility

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on making experiments clear enough that others can repeat them. Prompt: Why is it important for experiments to be reproducible?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Reproducibility ensures that results are reliable. If another scientist can't repeat an experiment and get the same result, it may not be valid.
