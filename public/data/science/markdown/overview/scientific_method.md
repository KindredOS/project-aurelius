## What is the Scientific Method?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the purpose and importance of the scientific method in structured inquiry. Prompt: How does the scientific method support reliable discovery?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The scientific method is a step-by-step approach to understanding the world through investigation. It provides a structured way to answer questions and solve problems using evidence.

## Step 1: Observation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how scientific inquiry begins with keen observation. Prompt: What kinds of things do scientists notice before they begin an investigation?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Observation involves using the senses or tools to notice something unusual, puzzling, or interesting in the natural world.

## Step 2: Question

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the formation of scientific questions based on observation. Prompt: What makes a question scientifically testable?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A good scientific question is clear, focused, and can be investigated through experimentation or data collection.

## Step 3: Hypothesis

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on how scientists make predictions. Prompt: What is a hypothesis, and how is it different from a guess?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A hypothesis is an educated prediction that explains a phenomenon and can be tested by an experiment.

## Step 4: Experiment

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces experimental design and variable control. Prompt: What are the key elements of a well-designed experiment?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

An experiment tests a hypothesis by manipulating variables and measuring outcomes under controlled conditions.

## Step 5: Analysis

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how scientists interpret data. Prompt: How can data reveal patterns or support conclusions?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientists use tools like graphs, tables, and statistics to identify patterns and relationships in their results.

\[interactive element]

## Step 6: Conclusion

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section examines how scientists determine what their findings mean. Prompt: What should a conclusion include in a scientific investigation?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A conclusion summarizes whether the hypothesis was supported, based on the data, and suggests possible next steps.

\[interactive element]

## Step 7: Communication

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights how findings are shared and reviewed. Prompt: Why is communication essential in science?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientists publish, present, and explain their results so others can replicate and build upon their work.

\[interactive element]

## Science as a Cycle

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section emphasizes that the method is iterative. Prompt: How do scientists cycle through the method more than once?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

New questions often emerge from conclusions, leading to new hypotheses and further investigation.

\[interactive element]

## Common Misconceptions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section addresses frequent misunderstandings about the scientific method. Prompt: What are some myths people believe about how science works?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

People often think science always proves things or follows a rigid sequence, but real-world science is more flexible and evolving.

\[interactive element]

## Reflection Questions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section prompts learners to connect personally with the method. Prompt: Have you ever used the scientific method without realizing it?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

* Can an experiment ever be “wrong”? Why or why not?
* What would happen if you skipped the analysis step?

## Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Thinking

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces two approaches to reasoning used in science: bottom-up (inductive) and top-down (deductive) thinking. Prompt: How do bottom-up and top-down thinking influence how scientists form and test ideas?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

**Bottom-up thinking** (inductive reasoning) begins with specific observations and builds up to broader generalizations or theories. It's about discovering patterns and generating hypotheses.

**Top-down thinking** (deductive reasoning) starts with general principles or theories and applies them to specific cases to predict outcomes or test validity.

Both methods are essential in the scientific process—induction helps form hypotheses, while deduction helps test them.
