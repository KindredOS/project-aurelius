## What Are Scientific Research Methods?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how scientists design and carry out investigations. Prompt: What makes a scientific investigation different from other types of research?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientific research methods involve structured steps to ask questions, collect data, and form evidence-based conclusions. These methods make investigations more reliable and repeatable.

## Planning an Investigation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on how scientists prepare for experiments. Prompt: What are the key decisions a scientist must make before starting an experiment?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Planning includes identifying a testable question, forming a hypothesis, selecting tools, defining variables, and outlining procedures.

## Observations and Questions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how research begins with curiosity. Prompt: Why are careful observations important in science?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Observing the world closely leads to interesting questions and new investigations. Scientists learn to observe using both tools and their senses.

## Hypothesis and Prediction

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers how scientists make educated guesses based on their observations. Prompt: How does a hypothesis guide the design of an experiment?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A hypothesis is a testable explanation. Scientists also make predictionsâ€”what they expect to happen if their hypothesis is true.

## Experimental Design

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes how scientists structure fair and reliable tests. Prompt: What does it mean for an experiment to be "controlled"?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A well-designed experiment tests one variable at a time while keeping others constant. This helps isolate cause and effect.

## Collecting and Recording Data

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section emphasizes the importance of accurate measurement and documentation. Prompt: What tools do scientists use to collect and record data?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientists use instruments like thermometers, scales, and timers. They record findings in journals, charts, or digital tools so nothing is forgotten.

## Repeating and Refining

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section shows how science improves through repeated testing. Prompt: Why do scientists often repeat their experiments?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Repetition builds confidence in results and helps identify mistakes or new patterns. Science often improves by revisiting and refining previous work.
