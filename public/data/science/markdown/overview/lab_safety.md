## Clean-Up and Waste Disposal

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section emphasizes end-of-experiment safety routines. Prompt: Why is cleanup just as important as setup in a science lab?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A clean lab prevents contamination and accidents. Waste must be sorted and disposed of according to safety rules to protect people and the environment.

## Research Methods

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how scientists plan and carry out investigations. Prompt: What does it mean to conduct a "controlled experiment"?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientific research involves planning, testing, and documenting. Controlled experiments isolate one variable while keeping others constant to test cause-and-effect relationships.

## Measurement and Documentation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how accurate measurements and notes support valid results. Prompt: How do scientists ensure their results can be trusted?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientists use tools to measure precisely, and they write down all steps, data, and observations. This creates a record that others can repeat or verify.

## Variables and Control

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section identifies different kinds of variables in an experiment. Prompt: What is the difference between independent, dependent, and controlled variables?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

* **Independent variable**: what you change
* **Dependent variable**: what you measure
* **Controlled variables**: what stays the same

Understanding variables helps design fair and meaningful experiments.
