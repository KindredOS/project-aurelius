## Charts and Graphs

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains common visual tools used in science. Prompt: How do graphs and charts help communicate results?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Graphs make data easier to understand. Line graphs show trends, bar graphs compare quantities, and pie charts show proportions. Choosing the right one makes results clearer.

## Descriptive Statistics

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces measures like average, range, and variation. Prompt: What can statistical tools tell us about a dataset?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Descriptive statistics summarize large amounts of data. Mean, median, mode, and range show central tendencies and spread. These tools help scientists interpret what the numbers mean.

## Interpreting Results

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on drawing conclusions from patterns in data. Prompt: How do scientists decide what their results really mean?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientists look for trends, consistency, or unexpected results. They compare data to their hypothesis and decide whether the experiment supports it—or raises new questions.

## Sources of Error

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores factors that can affect the accuracy of data. Prompt: What kinds of things can cause an experiment’s results to be misleading?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Mistakes in measurement, poor tools, or uncontrolled variables can all introduce error. Scientists must identify these and consider how they affect the reliability of the data.
