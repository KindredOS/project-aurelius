## Soil Science and Fertility

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the importance of healthy soil. Prompt: Why is soil considered a living system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Soil provides nutrients, stores water, and supports plant roots. Scientists study soil composition, pH, and microbial life to improve fertility. Techniques like composting and crop rotation help maintain long-term soil health.

## Pest and Disease Management

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses how to protect crops. Prompt: What are the risks and benefits of using pesticides in farming?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Farmers use pesticides and biological controls to defend against insects, weeds, and fungi. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines methods to minimize harm to people, pollinators, and the environment.
