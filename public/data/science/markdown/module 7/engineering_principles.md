## What Are Engineering Principles?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the foundational ideas that guide engineering. Prompt: What makes engineering different from science?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Engineering applies scientific knowledge to design, build, and test solutions to real-world problems. While science seeks to understand how the world works, engineering focuses on creating tools, systems, and processes that solve specific needs.

## The Engineering Design Process

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section outlines the step-by-step method engineers use to solve problems. Prompt: What steps are involved in creating an engineered solution?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The engineering design process includes identifying the problem, researching, brainstorming ideas, creating prototypes, testing solutions, and refining designs. It is an iterative process that emphasizes improvement through testing and feedback.

## Prototyping and Iteration

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how trial and error improve engineering outcomes. Prompt: Why is prototyping important in engineering?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Prototypes are early models used to test concepts. Engineers use them to find flaws, improve performance, and save time and resources before final production. Iteration means repeating and refining until the solution works optimally.
