## Genetics & Inheritance

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how traits are passed from parents to offspring. Prompt: How do traits get passed down through generations?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Genetics is the science of heredity. It explains how traits like eye color or blood type are transmitted through DNA from one generation to the next. Genes—segments of DNA—carry the instructions that determine an organism’s characteristics.

## DNA and Chromosomes

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the structure of genetic material. Prompt: What is DNA, and how is it organized in cells?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule shaped like a double helix. It’s organized into chromosomes found in the nucleus. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes containing tens of thousands of genes.

## Genes and Traits

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how genes influence physical characteristics. Prompt: How do genes determine what you look like?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Each gene carries information for a specific trait. Different versions of a gene, called alleles, can produce variations—such as blue or brown eyes. Traits can be dominant or recessive depending on the alleles inherited.

## Mendelian Inheritance

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces Gregor Mendel's work with pea plants. Prompt: What patterns of inheritance did Mendel discover?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Mendel discovered that traits are inherited in predictable patterns. His laws of segregation and independent assortment explain how traits are passed independently and how some traits can skip a generation.

## Punnett Squares and Probability

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how to predict inheritance patterns. Prompt: How can we predict the chance of inheriting a trait?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Punnett squares are tools used to model genetic crosses. By analyzing the possible combinations of parental alleles, we can estimate the probability of an offspring having certain traits.

## Genetic Variation and Mutation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section examines the sources of differences in DNA. Prompt: What causes genetic differences between individuals?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Genetic variation arises from mutations, sexual reproduction, and genetic recombination. Mutations are changes in DNA that can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Variation fuels evolution and adaptation.

## Hereditary Disorders

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces inherited diseases. Prompt: How can genes sometimes lead to health problems?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Some disorders are caused by mutations or defective alleles. Examples include cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. Understanding inheritance helps doctors diagnose and sometimes prevent these conditions.
