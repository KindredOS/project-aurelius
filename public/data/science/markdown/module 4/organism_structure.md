## Organism Structure & Function

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how living organisms are built and how their structures support survival. Prompt: How do the parts of a plant or animal help it live and grow?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

All living organisms are made of systems and structures designed to carry out life functions. From roots and stems in plants to lungs and muscles in animals, each part has a job that helps the organism survive and thrive.

## Levels of Organization

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how biological systems are arranged. Prompt: What are the building blocks of life from cell to organism?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Living systems are organized in levels: cells → tissues → organs → organ systems → organisms. Each level works together to maintain health and carry out functions.

## Plant Structures and Functions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the major parts of plants. Prompt: How do leaves, stems, and roots support plant life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Roots absorb water and nutrients. Stems support and transport materials. Leaves perform photosynthesis. Flowers and seeds support reproduction. Each structure is vital to plant survival.

## Animal Body Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights the major systems in animals. Prompt: What do systems like digestion and circulation do for an animal?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Animals have specialized systems like the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems. Each system has organs working together to keep the body alive and functioning.

## Adaptations for Survival

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers how structure relates to an organism’s environment. Prompt: How are animals and plants shaped by where they live?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Organisms develop traits suited to their environments. Camouflage, thick fur, waxy leaves, or strong roots are structural adaptations that improve survival and reproduction.

## Specialized Structures

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section looks at unique features in certain organisms. Prompt: What special parts help some organisms thrive in extreme conditions?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Some organisms have unusual features—like cacti storing water or deep-sea fish with glowing organs. These specialized structures are evolutionary solutions to environmental challenges.

## Comparative Anatomy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section compares anatomy across species. Prompt: What do similar body parts tell us about evolution?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Comparing limbs, organs, or skeletons across species shows patterns of shared ancestry. Homologous structures suggest evolutionary relationships and adaptations over time.
