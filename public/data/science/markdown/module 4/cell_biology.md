## Cell Biology

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the structure and function of cells. Prompt: How do different organelles contribute to a cell's job?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Cells are the foundation of all living organisms. Each cell is a complex, organized structure with parts called organelles, each responsible for a specific task. From converting energy to transporting materials, these tiny units perform vital life functions.

## Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section compares the two major types of cells. Prompt: What makes prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells different?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Prokaryotic cells, like bacteria, lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells, found in plants, animals, and fungi, have a nucleus and more complex internal structures. Both perform essential life functions.

## Cell Membrane and Transport

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how substances move in and out of cells. Prompt: How do cells control what enters and exits?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The cell membrane is a flexible barrier that controls movement of substances. Passive transport (like diffusion) requires no energy, while active transport uses energy to move materials against a gradient.

## Nucleus and Genetic Control

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers the role of the nucleus in cells. Prompt: How does the nucleus control the cell?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The nucleus contains DNA, the instructions for building proteins and regulating cell function. It acts as the control center, coordinating activities like growth and reproduction.

## Mitochondria and Energy Production

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on the cell's powerhouse. Prompt: How do cells make energy from food?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Mitochondria break down sugars to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell. This process, called cellular respiration, is vital for powering all other functions.

## Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights energy production in plant cells. Prompt: How do plants turn sunlight into energy?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Chloroplasts are found in plant cells and use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create glucose through photosynthesis. This process supports nearly all life on Earth.

## Other Key Organelles

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores organelles like the ER, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Prompt: What do lesser-known organelles do for the cell?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) help produce and transport proteins, the Golgi apparatus modifies and packages them, and lysosomes break down waste. Each plays a specialized role in cell health.

## Cell Specialization

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how cells take on different roles in multicellular organisms. Prompt: Why don’t all cells look or act the same?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

In multicellular organisms, cells become specialized to perform distinct tasks—like muscle contraction or oxygen transport. This allows complex organisms to function efficiently.
