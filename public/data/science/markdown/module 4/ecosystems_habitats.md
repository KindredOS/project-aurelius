## Ecosystems & Habitats

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces ecosystems and the roles organisms play within them. Prompt: What makes an ecosystem work, and how do living things interact?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Ecosystems are communities of living organisms and their physical environments, interacting through the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients. Each organism plays a specific role, helping maintain balance in nature.

## Biotic and Abiotic Factors

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section examines the living and non-living parts of an ecosystem. Prompt: How do things like sunlight and water shape where life can exist?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Biotic factors include plants, animals, fungi, and microbes. Abiotic factors include sunlight, water, soil, and temperature. Together, these elements shape what organisms can thrive in an environment.

## Food Chains and Webs

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how energy moves through ecosystems. Prompt: What happens if one species in a food web disappears?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Food chains show the flow of energy from producers to consumers. Food webs are more complex, showing how multiple organisms are interconnected. Disruptions can ripple through the whole system.

## Producers, Consumers, and Decomposers

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes the roles organisms play in energy transfer. Prompt: Why are decomposers as important as predators?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Producers like plants create energy-rich food. Consumers eat other organisms. Decomposers break down dead material and recycle nutrients. All are essential for ecosystem health.

## Types of Habitats

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces different biomes on Earth. Prompt: How do organisms adapt to their specific habitats?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

From forests and deserts to oceans and tundras, each habitat has unique conditions. Organisms develop traits suited to survive in these environments, like thick fur or drought resistance.

## Niche and Competition

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how species find their place in an ecosystem. Prompt: Why don’t all species eat the same food or live the same way?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Each species has a niche—a role it plays and the conditions it needs. When niches overlap, competition can occur, affecting population sizes and survival.

## Biodiversity

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights the importance of variety in life forms. Prompt: Why is having many species in an ecosystem a good thing?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Biodiversity supports ecosystem resilience. Diverse systems can better resist disease, adapt to change, and provide more resources for life. Loss of species weakens ecosystems.

## Human Impact on Habitats

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how people change natural environments. Prompt: How do our actions affect the balance of ecosystems?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Urbanization, pollution, deforestation, and climate change can disrupt habitats and lead to species loss. Understanding our impact helps guide conservation and sustainable living.
