## What is Life?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the characteristics and classifications of living things. Prompt: How do scientists determine whether something is alive?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Life is defined by a set of observable characteristics that distinguish living organisms from non-living matter. These characteristics include the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, maintain homeostasis, undergo metabolism, and evolve over generations.

## The Cell: Basic Unit of Life

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains the importance of cells in defining living organisms. Prompt: Why are cells considered the basic units of life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

All living things are composed of one or more cells. Cells carry out essential processes such as energy conversion, waste removal, and reproduction. Multicellular organisms have specialized cells that perform distinct roles.

## Growth and Reproduction

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how organisms grow and produce offspring. Prompt: How do living organisms increase in size and pass on their traits?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Growth involves cell division and expansion, allowing organisms to develop. Reproduction ensures continuity of life, either sexually or asexually, transferring genetic information to the next generation.

## Response to Stimuli

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section looks at how organisms detect and respond to their environment. Prompt: Why is responsiveness important for survival?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Living organisms react to internal and external changesâ€”light, temperature, touch, or danger. This responsiveness helps them adapt and survive in dynamic environments.

## Metabolism and Energy Use

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section investigates how living organisms obtain and use energy. Prompt: How does metabolism support life functions?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Metabolism includes all chemical reactions within an organism. It transforms food or sunlight into usable energy for growth, repair, and activity. Examples include cellular respiration and photosynthesis.

## Homeostasis

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses how organisms maintain internal balance. Prompt: What is homeostasis, and why is it vital?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Homeostasis is the ability to maintain stable internal conditions despite external changes. This includes regulating temperature, pH, water levels, and more.

## Adaptation and Evolution

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how traits change over generations. Prompt: How do living organisms adapt over time?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Through natural selection and mutation, species develop traits suited for their environment. Evolution explains the diversity and complexity of life on Earth.

## Classification of Life

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how scientists group living things. Prompt: How do we organize and identify living organisms?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Scientists classify organisms based on shared features such as cell type, genetic makeup, and method of obtaining energy. The major domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, which include kingdoms like Animalia and Plantae.
