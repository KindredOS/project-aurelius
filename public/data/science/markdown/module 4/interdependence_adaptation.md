## Interdependence & Adaptation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how organisms rely on each other and adapt to survive. Prompt: How do living things depend on one another to live and grow?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

All life is interconnected. From food webs to shelter and reproduction, species depend on others for survival. Adaptation helps organisms respond to their environment and improve their chances of survival.

## Symbiosis

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section looks at close relationships between species. Prompt: How do some organisms benefit from living together?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Symbiosis includes mutualism (both benefit), commensalism (one benefits, the other is unaffected), and parasitism (one benefits, one is harmed). These relationships shape ecosystems.

## Predation and Competition

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how species interact for resources. Prompt: What happens when animals compete or hunt each other?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Predators hunt prey to survive, while competition occurs when species seek the same resource. These forces influence population sizes and ecosystem balance.

## Adaptation and Natural Selection

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how organisms change over generations. Prompt: How do traits help a species survive?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Adaptations are traits shaped by natural selection to fit the environment. Over time, helpful traits become more common, leading to the evolution of species.

## Behavioral Adaptations

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on how actions help organisms survive. Prompt: What behaviors do animals use to stay alive?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Behaviors like migration, hibernation, hunting strategies, or mating rituals are adaptations that help animals meet their needs in changing conditions.

## Physical Adaptations

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights structural traits for survival. Prompt: How do physical features help living things thrive?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Physical adaptations like thick fur, long roots, or sharp teeth allow organisms to survive in harsh environments or better access food and shelter.

## Adaptation in Extreme Environments

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores life in unusual places. Prompt: How do some organisms survive in places like deserts or deep oceans?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Organisms in extreme environments evolve unique traits, like heat-resistant proteins, salt-tolerant leaves, or light-producing organs in the deep sea.

## Coevolution

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section looks at how species evolve together. Prompt: How do some organisms shape each other’s evolution?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Coevolution occurs when two species influence each other’s adaptations—like flowers and pollinators or predator-prey arms races. These relationships can be tightly linked over time.
