## Nervous & Endocrine Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how the brain, spinal cord, and hormones control body functions. Prompt: How do the nervous and endocrine systems help the body respond and adapt?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **nervous system** uses electrical signals to transmit information quickly between the brain, spinal cord, and body. The **endocrine system** uses chemical messengers called hormones to regulate processes like growth, metabolism, and mood. Together, they coordinate the body’s response to stimuli and maintain internal balance.

The nervous system acts instantly, while the endocrine system has longer-lasting effects. This dynamic partnership keeps the body alert and stable, able to react to danger, maintain energy levels, and manage stress or development over time.

## Structure of the Nervous System

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Prompt: What are the major parts of the nervous system and their roles?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The nervous system is divided into the **central nervous system (CNS)**—brain and spinal cord—and the **peripheral nervous system (PNS)**—nerves extending to the rest of the body. The brain processes information, the spinal cord relays signals, and nerves carry messages to and from muscles and organs.

## Types of Nerves and Signals

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how signals travel through the body. Prompt: What are sensory and motor neurons, and how do they work?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

**Sensory neurons** carry information from the body to the brain (like touch or temperature), while **motor neurons** send commands from the brain to muscles. Signals travel as electrical impulses across specialized cells and synapses, enabling fast communication.

## Reflexes and Response Time

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section examines quick, automatic actions. Prompt: What is a reflex, and why is it important?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A **reflex** is an automatic response to a stimulus, like pulling your hand away from something hot. Reflexes bypass the brain and are processed in the spinal cord for speed. They protect the body from harm and maintain posture and balance.

## Introduction to the Endocrine System

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section provides an overview of hormone regulation. Prompt: What does the endocrine system do and how is it different from the nervous system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **endocrine system** consists of glands like the **pituitary**, **thyroid**, and **adrenal** glands. These glands secrete **hormones** into the bloodstream to control growth, energy use, mood, and reproduction. Unlike fast nervous impulses, hormonal responses are slower but last longer.

## Hormones and Their Functions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes common hormones and their roles. Prompt: Can you name a hormone and explain what it does?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Examples of hormones include **insulin** (regulates blood sugar), **adrenaline** (prepares the body for action), and **estrogen/testosterone** (regulate reproduction and development). Hormones act on specific target organs and influence a wide range of body functions.

## The Brain-Body Connection

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how the brain coordinates with the endocrine system. Prompt: How does the brain influence hormone production?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **hypothalamus**, located in the brain, links the nervous and endocrine systems. It sends signals to the **pituitary gland**, often called the "master gland," which in turn controls other glands in the body. This connection ensures the body reacts appropriately to physical and emotional changes.

## Stress and the Body’s Response

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how the body handles stress. Prompt: What happens in your body when you feel stressed?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

During stress, the brain signals the adrenal glands to release **cortisol** and **adrenaline**. These hormones increase heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels to prepare for a "fight or flight" response. Managing stress through rest, exercise, and support is vital for health.
