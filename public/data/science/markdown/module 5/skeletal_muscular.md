## Skeletal & Muscular Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how bones and muscles work together to support the body and enable movement. Prompt: How do the skeletal and muscular systems interact to allow your body to move?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **skeletal system** provides the rigid framework of the body, made up of bones that support, protect, and give shape to the human form. The **muscular system** includes the muscles that attach to these bones and generate movement through contraction. Together, these systems create the **musculoskeletal system**, which enables everything from standing upright to sprinting and dancing.

Movement happens through joints where bones meet and muscles pull on bones to create motion. Ligaments and tendons play important roles in connecting bones and muscles, ensuring stability and flexibility. Maintaining strong bones and flexible muscles is key to injury prevention and mobility.

## Major Bones of the Human Body

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the main bones of the body and their roles. Prompt: Can you identify key bones in your body and describe what they do?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The human skeleton contains over 200 bones. Major bones include the **skull** (protecting the brain), **spine** (supporting posture), **ribcage** (shielding the heart and lungs), **femur** (thigh bone and strongest in the body), and **humerus** (upper arm). These bones form the structure that supports vital organs and provides leverage for movement.

## Major Muscle Groups

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section highlights the bodyâ€™s major muscle groups and their movements. Prompt: What are the main muscle groups and what types of movement do they enable?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Major muscle groups include the **quadriceps** and **hamstrings** (legs), **biceps** and **triceps** (arms), **abdominals** (core), and **deltoids** and **trapezius** (shoulders and back). Muscles work in pairs: one contracts while the other relaxes, allowing limbs to move efficiently and precisely.

## Types of Muscle Tissue

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the three types of muscle tissue. Prompt: What are the differences between skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The body contains three types of muscle: **skeletal** (voluntary movement), **cardiac** (heart contractions), and **smooth** (involuntary actions in organs like the stomach). Each type has a unique structure and function vital to health and activity.

## Joints and Movement

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how joints allow different types of movement. Prompt: What kinds of joints are there, and how do they move?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Joints are where two or more bones meet. **Hinge joints** (like elbows and knees) allow bending, **ball-and-socket joints** (like shoulders and hips) allow rotation, and **pivot joints** (like the neck) allow twisting. Healthy joints enable a wide range of motion.

## Muscle Contraction and Control

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes how muscles contract and are controlled. Prompt: How does your brain communicate with muscles to make them move?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Muscles contract when they receive signals from **motor neurons**, which are controlled by the brain and spinal cord. These electrical signals cause muscle fibers to shorten, pulling on bones to produce movement. Reflexes are fast, automatic responses that also involve muscular control.

## Injury Prevention and Care

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on common injuries and how to prevent them. Prompt: What can you do to avoid muscle and bone injuries during physical activity?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Common injuries include **sprains**, **strains**, and **fractures**. Proper warm-up, stretching, strength training, hydration, and using protective gear all help prevent injury. Recognizing pain signals and resting when needed is key to long-term health.

## Growth and Bone Health

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses how bones grow and how to keep them strong. Prompt: What habits support healthy bones throughout life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Bones grow rapidly during childhood and adolescence. To maintain bone health, the body needs nutrients like **calcium** and **vitamin D**, as well as regular weight-bearing exercise. Good posture and lifestyle habits, like avoiding smoking, also contribute to skeletal strength.
