## Immune System & Disease

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how the body defends itself from illness. Prompt: How does the immune system protect the body from harmful invaders?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **immune system** is the body's defense network. It identifies and attacks harmful invaders like **bacteria**, **viruses**, and **parasites** while distinguishing them from the body’s own healthy cells. This protection involves physical barriers (like skin), immune cells, and antibodies that work together to fight infection.

When pathogens are detected, immune cells respond by attacking and neutralizing the threat. This system keeps the body healthy, learns from past infections, and builds immunity to prevent future illness.

## Types of Immunity

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains the difference between innate and adaptive immunity. Prompt: What are the two main types of immunity, and how do they work?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

**Innate immunity** is the body's first line of defense and reacts quickly to threats. **Adaptive immunity** is more specialized—it learns from past encounters and responds more effectively each time. Vaccines train the adaptive immune system to recognize specific threats.

## The Role of White Blood Cells

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes how white blood cells help fight disease. Prompt: What do white blood cells do in the immune response?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

White blood cells such as **macrophages**, **T cells**, and **B cells** detect and destroy harmful invaders. B cells produce antibodies, while T cells kill infected cells or help direct other immune responses. These cells travel in the bloodstream and lymph system.

## Antibodies and Antigens

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how the body recognizes and remembers threats. Prompt: What are antibodies and how do they protect you?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

**Antigens** are markers on the surface of pathogens that trigger an immune response. The body creates **antibodies** to bind to these markers and neutralize the threat. Once antibodies are created, the body remembers the invader for faster defense in the future.

## Vaccines and Prevention

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how vaccines help build immunity. Prompt: How do vaccines help prevent disease?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Vaccines contain harmless parts of pathogens or weakened versions of them. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies without causing illness. This prepares the body to fight the real pathogen if exposed in the future, reducing the risk of serious disease.

## Common Diseases and Disorders

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section reviews diseases that challenge the immune system. Prompt: What are some common immune-related diseases and how do they affect the body?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Common illnesses include **influenza**, **strep throat**, and **chickenpox**. Autoimmune disorders like **lupus** and **type 1 diabetes** occur when the immune system attacks healthy tissues. Understanding these conditions helps with early treatment and prevention.

## The Lymphatic System

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the system that supports immune function. Prompt: What is the lymphatic system and how does it help the immune system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **lymphatic system** is a network of vessels and nodes that transport **lymph**, a fluid containing immune cells. It filters pathogens and helps circulate white blood cells. Lymph nodes swell when fighting infection, signaling immune activity.

## Epidemiology and Public Health

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how diseases are tracked and prevented. Prompt: What is epidemiology, and how does it help protect communities?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

**Epidemiology** is the study of how diseases spread and affect populations. Public health officials use this science to identify outbreaks, develop prevention strategies, and educate communities. Clean water, sanitation, and vaccination programs save millions of lives.
