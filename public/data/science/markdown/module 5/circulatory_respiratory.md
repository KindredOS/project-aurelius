## Circulatory & Respiratory Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how the heart, blood vessels, and lungs work together to deliver oxygen and remove waste. Prompt: How do the circulatory and respiratory systems function together to keep your body alive?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The **circulatory system**—made up of the heart, blood, and blood vessels—transports nutrients, gases, hormones, and waste throughout the body. The **respiratory system** brings oxygen into the body through the lungs and removes carbon dioxide. These systems work together to ensure that every cell receives the oxygen it needs and can expel waste gases.

When you inhale, oxygen enters the lungs and diffuses into the bloodstream. The heart then pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body, while collecting carbon dioxide-rich blood to send back to the lungs for exhalation. This continuous loop is essential for survival and energy production.

## Anatomy of the Heart

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes the heart’s structure and how it pumps blood. Prompt: What are the major parts of the heart and what do they do?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The human heart has four chambers: two **atria** and two **ventricles**. Valves ensure one-way flow of blood. The right side of the heart sends blood to the lungs, while the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. This muscular organ beats over 100,000 times a day to keep circulation going.

## Blood and Its Components

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains the contents of blood and their functions. Prompt: What are the main components of blood and how do they support the body?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Blood is made up of **red blood cells** (carry oxygen), **white blood cells** (fight infection), **platelets** (aid clotting), and **plasma** (the liquid that transports nutrients and hormones). These elements work together to maintain health and respond to injury or infection.

## Blood Vessels and Circulation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section focuses on arteries, veins, and capillaries. Prompt: What are the different types of blood vessels and how do they work together?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

**Arteries** carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, **veins** return deoxygenated blood back to the heart, and **capillaries** are tiny vessels where gas and nutrient exchange occurs. These vessels form a vast, branching network throughout the body.

## The Lungs and Breathing

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section outlines how air enters the body and is exchanged for carbon dioxide. Prompt: What path does air take through the respiratory system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Air enters through the **nose or mouth**, travels down the **trachea**, and branches into the **bronchi** and then into the **lungs**. Inside the lungs, tiny air sacs called **alveoli** exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with capillaries. This process is known as **gas exchange**.

## Oxygen Transport and Delivery

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how oxygen is transported in the body. Prompt: How does oxygen from the lungs reach every cell in your body?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Once in the lungs, oxygen binds to **hemoglobin** in red blood cells. The heart pumps these cells throughout the body via arteries, delivering oxygen to organs and tissues. The same red blood cells then carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation.

## Heart and Lung Health

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses ways to maintain a healthy circulatory and respiratory system. Prompt: What habits help keep your heart and lungs strong?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Regular exercise, a balanced diet, avoiding smoking, and managing stress all support cardiovascular and respiratory health. Deep breathing exercises, good posture, and clean air environments can also improve lung function.

## Disorders of the Heart and Lungs

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section examines common conditions and their impact. Prompt: What are some common heart and lung diseases, and how can they be prevented?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Conditions such as **asthma**, **pneumonia**, **hypertension**, and **heart disease** can affect breathing and circulation. Preventive care, early diagnosis, and healthy lifestyle choices are essential in managing these risks.
