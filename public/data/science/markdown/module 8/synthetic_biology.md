## Gene Drives and Ecosystem Engineering

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the use of gene drives to alter wild populations. Prompt: Should humans use gene drives to control or eliminate species?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Gene drives can spread genetic traits rapidly through populations, potentially eradicating disease-carrying mosquitoes or invasive species. But they pose ecological risks and demand careful governance and public consent.

## The Future of Life

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section reflects on how synthetic biology might redefine life itself. Prompt: How far should we go in designing or redesigning life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

As we gain control over biology, the line between natural and artificial blurs. Synthetic biology challenges our definitions of life, evolution, and nature—inviting deep philosophical and scientific reflection.
