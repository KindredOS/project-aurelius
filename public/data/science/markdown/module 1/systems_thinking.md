## Systems Thinking

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces systems thinking as a way to understand complex interactions in nature and technology. Prompt: What is a system, and how do the parts work together?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A system is a set of parts working together as a whole. Systems thinking helps us understand how inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback interact. Whether it's a living cell, a car engine, or the climate, systems thinking helps reveal patterns, causes, and connections.

## What is a System?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section defines the concept of a system. Prompt: Can you think of something in your life that works as a system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A system consists of components that interact to perform a function. Systems can be natural (like the water cycle) or human-made (like a smartphone). Understanding parts and relationships helps explain how systems operate.

## Input, Process, Output, Feedback

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains the four key elements of system function. Prompt: What happens when part of a system breaks or changes?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Systems work by receiving inputs, performing processes, producing outputs, and adjusting based on feedback. For example, in a thermostat system, input is temperature, the process is decision-making, and output is turning heating on or off.

## Natural Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores systems found in nature. Prompt: How does the ecosystem act like a system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Natural systems include weather, food chains, and body systems. Each part has a role, and small changes can have large impacts. For example, a decline in bees affects pollination and entire food webs.

## Human-Made Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores engineered systems. Prompt: What systems do people design to solve problems?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Human-made systems include transportation networks, computers, and plumbing. These systems are designed with specific goals and often mirror natural systems in structure and feedback loops.

## Interconnectedness

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section shows how systems affect one another. Prompt: How might changing one part of a system affect other systems?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Systems often link to others. For instance, using fossil fuels in energy systems affects climate systems. Recognizing interconnectedness helps prevent unintended consequences and supports sustainable thinking.

## Models and Diagrams

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces visual tools for systems thinking. Prompt: How can diagrams help us understand complex systems?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

We use diagrams, maps, and models to show how systems are structured. Flowcharts, feedback loops, and system maps make it easier to see relationships and analyze cause and effect.

## System Boundaries

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how to define limits within a system. Prompt: Why does it matter where we draw the line around a system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Boundaries define what’s included in a system and what’s external. For example, a car system includes the engine but not the road. Clear boundaries help us focus and study system performance accurately.

## System Behavior Over Time

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how systems change. Prompt: Why is it important to look at patterns over time instead of single events?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Systems can grow, decline, or stabilize. Observing trends over time reveals patterns, delays, and feedback effects. This helps predict future outcomes and plan interventions more effectively.

## Open vs. Closed Systems

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section compares different system types. Prompt: What is the difference between an open and a closed system?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Open systems exchange matter or energy with their surroundings (like ecosystems), while closed systems don’t (like sealed lab experiments). Most real-world systems are open and influenced by external factors.

## Applying Systems Thinking

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section encourages using systems thinking in daily life. Prompt: How can thinking in systems help solve big challenges?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Systems thinking is useful in solving real-world problems like climate change, public health, or supply chain issues. It encourages big-picture thinking, identifying root causes, and designing better long-term solutions.
