## Simple Machines

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces simple machines and how they help us do work. Prompt: How can machines make work easier?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Simple machines are tools that change the direction or magnitude of a force. They make it easier to lift, move, or secure loads by increasing mechanical advantage. Understanding these devices is the foundation of engineering and invention.

## Types of Simple Machines

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section lists and defines the six classic simple machines. Prompt: Can you find examples of simple machines in your everyday life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The six simple machines are: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, screw, and wedge. These basic tools are found in countless everyday objects and machines.

## Levers

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how levers work. Prompt: What’s the advantage of using a crowbar or seesaw?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A lever is a rigid bar that pivots around a point (fulcrum) to lift or move a load. The closer the fulcrum is to the load, the less effort is needed. Levers come in three classes based on the position of effort, load, and fulcrum.

## Pulleys

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces pulleys and how they redirect force. Prompt: How do pulleys help lift heavy things?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Pulleys use wheels and ropes to change the direction of a force. A single fixed pulley redirects effort, while compound pulleys reduce the effort needed to lift a load by distributing force across multiple wheels.

## Inclined Planes

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how ramps reduce effort. Prompt: Why is it easier to push something up a ramp than lift it straight up?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Inclined planes, or ramps, allow objects to be raised using less force over a longer distance. They’re commonly used in loading docks, wheelchair access ramps, and mountain roads.

## Wheels and Axles

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes rotational tools. Prompt: How do wheels help reduce effort in motion?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A wheel and axle is a circular frame that turns around a central rod. The rotation reduces friction and helps move loads. Examples include doorknobs, carts, and bicycles.

## Screws

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers spiral tools for securing and lifting. Prompt: How does twisting a screw help hold or lift objects?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. Turning the screw converts rotational force into linear motion, securing or lifting objects with precision. It’s used in tools, jars, and elevators.

## Wedges

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores tools that cut or split. Prompt: How do knives, axes, or chisels make cutting easier?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A wedge is a device that converts force into a splitting or cutting action. It’s made of two inclined planes joined together. Wedges concentrate force into a narrow area to separate materials.

## Mechanical Advantage

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how simple machines reduce effort. Prompt: How can machines let us lift more with less force?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Mechanical advantage is the ratio of output force to input force. Simple machines multiply effort, allowing users to apply less force to achieve the same result. Higher mechanical advantage means less effort needed.

## Compound Machines

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces combinations of simple machines. Prompt: What happens when you combine multiple simple machines into one tool?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Compound machines combine two or more simple machines to perform complex tasks. Scissors, bicycles, and wheelbarrows are examples. These systems build on basic principles to create powerful tools.

## Designing with Machines in Mind

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section connects machines to problem-solving. Prompt: How do designers use simple machines to build helpful tools?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Engineers and inventors use simple machines in design to reduce effort, improve safety, and solve real-world problems. From cranks to cranes, understanding simple mechanics is key to innovation.
