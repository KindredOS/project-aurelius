## Forces & Motion

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces fundamental concepts of force and motion, beginning with Newton's Laws. Prompt: What happens when you push or pull an object, and why does it move (or not move)?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Force is a push or pull that causes objects to move, stop, or change direction. Motion describes how something moves over time. Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics and help us understand how forces influence the motion of objects in our everyday world.

## Newton's First Law (Inertia)

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how motion continues unless a force acts on an object. Prompt: Why do objects in motion stay in motion unless something stops them?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Newton's First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by a net external force. This property is called inertia—the resistance of an object to change in its state of motion.

## Newton's Second Law (F=ma)

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers how force, mass, and acceleration are related. Prompt: How does changing the force or mass affect the motion of an object?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Newton’s Second Law shows that the acceleration of an object depends on the force applied to it and its mass. This is expressed by the equation F = ma (force = mass × acceleration). A heavier object needs more force to accelerate the same amount.

## Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction)

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how forces come in pairs. Prompt: What happens when you jump off a small boat and it moves backward?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Newton’s Third Law describes how forces always come in pairs. When you push on something, it pushes back with equal force in the opposite direction.

## Gravity

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses gravity as a universal force. Prompt: Why do things fall toward the Earth, and how does mass affect gravity?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Gravity is the force of attraction between objects with mass. Earth’s gravity pulls objects toward its center. The greater the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull. Gravity keeps planets in orbit and gives weight to objects.

## Friction

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes how surfaces resist motion. Prompt: Why is it harder to slide a heavy box on carpet than on a smooth floor?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Friction is the resistance that occurs when two surfaces rub against each other. It slows down or stops motion and depends on the texture of the surfaces and how much force is pressing them together.

## Magnetism

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores magnetic forces. Prompt: How can magnets attract or repel each other without touching?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Magnetism is a force produced by moving electric charges. Magnets have north and south poles. Like poles repel, and opposite poles attract. Magnetic fields act at a distance, allowing magnets to interact without direct contact.

## Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how net forces determine motion. Prompt: What happens when forces on an object are not equal?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Balanced forces cancel each other out and do not change an object’s motion. Unbalanced forces cause acceleration—starting, stopping, or changing direction. Net force is the sum of all forces acting on an object.

## Force Diagrams

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces visual tools for analyzing forces. Prompt: How can you use arrows to represent and predict how objects move?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Force diagrams (also called free-body diagrams) show all the forces acting on an object using arrows. Each arrow shows the direction and magnitude of a force, helping to predict motion or equilibrium.

## Motion and Speed

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section defines motion, speed, and reference points. Prompt: How do you know if something is moving, and how fast?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Motion is the change in position of an object relative to a reference point. Speed is how fast something moves, calculated by distance divided by time. Constant speed, average speed, and instantaneous speed describe different motion patterns.

## Velocity and Acceleration

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section builds on motion with direction and rate of change. Prompt: What’s the difference between speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Velocity includes both speed and direction. Acceleration is any change in velocity—speeding up, slowing down, or turning. Forces cause acceleration, and it’s measured as the rate of change in velocity over time.

## Real-World Applications of Forces & Motion

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section connects theory to everyday experiences. Prompt: How do athletes, engineers, and designers use force and motion in their work?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Forces and motion appear everywhere—from sports to car safety to rollercoasters. Engineers use these principles to build efficient machines. Athletes adjust form to maximize force and minimize friction. Understanding motion improves performance and safety.
