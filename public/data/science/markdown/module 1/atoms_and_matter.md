## Atoms & Matter

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces atoms as the fundamental building blocks of matter and explores their internal structure and states. Prompt: What are atoms made of, and how do they combine to form different materials?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Atoms are the basic units of matter, composed of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) and a cloud of electrons orbiting around it. These particles give each atom its identity and properties. When atoms bond together, they form molecules that make up elements, compounds, and mixtures. Matter exists in different states—solid, liquid, gas, and plasma—based on how its particles interact and move.

## Atomic Structure

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section breaks down the internal structure of atoms. Prompt: How do protons, neutrons, and electrons determine an atom's identity and behavior?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Atoms contain a dense nucleus of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The number of protons (atomic number) determines the element, while electrons influence chemical behavior. Isotopes vary in neutrons, and ions form when electrons are gained or lost.

## Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section compares different types of substances. Prompt: What is the difference between an element, a compound, and a mixture?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

An element is a pure substance made of one type of atom. Compounds are substances formed from atoms of different elements bonded in fixed ratios. Mixtures contain multiple substances physically combined without bonding, and can be homogeneous or heterogeneous.

## States of Matter

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the four main states of matter. Prompt: How does particle behavior define the state of a material?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Matter commonly exists as solid, liquid, gas, or plasma. In solids, particles are tightly packed and vibrate. Liquids flow with more particle movement. Gases spread freely, and plasmas—found in stars—are ionized gases with high energy.

## Phase Changes

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how matter changes between states. Prompt: What happens at the molecular level during a phase change like melting or evaporation?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Phase changes occur when energy is added or removed, altering particle motion. Melting turns solids to liquids, boiling creates gases, and freezing or condensation reduces motion. Each change involves specific energy exchange but doesn't alter the substance's identity.

## Atomic Models Over Time

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section traces the development of atomic theory. Prompt: How have models of the atom evolved as new discoveries were made?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

From Dalton’s solid sphere model to Thomson’s plum pudding, Rutherford’s nucleus-based view, and Bohr’s orbits to today’s quantum model—each theory reflected advances in technology and understanding of subatomic behavior.

## The Periodic Table

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how elements are organized. Prompt: How does the periodic table help us understand atomic structure and properties?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The periodic table groups elements by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Rows are periods, columns are groups. Elements in the same group behave similarly, revealing patterns in reactivity and bonding.

## Chemical Bonds

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores how atoms connect to form compounds. Prompt: What are the main types of chemical bonds, and how do they form?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Atoms form chemical bonds—ionic (electron transfer), covalent (electron sharing), and metallic (electron pooling)—to achieve stable electron arrangements. These bonds influence the properties of the resulting compounds.

## Molecules and Formulas

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces how compounds are represented. Prompt: How do we use chemical formulas to understand molecular composition?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Molecular formulas show the type and number of atoms in a compound (e.g., H2O). Structural formulas display bonding. Understanding formulas helps decode reactions, predict properties, and communicate chemistry clearly.

## Plasma and Ionization

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the unique state of plasma. Prompt: What makes plasma different from other states of matter?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Plasma is an ionized gas found in stars and neon lights. It forms when high energy strips electrons from atoms. Plasmas conduct electricity, generate magnetic fields, and are key in both natural and industrial processes.

## Conservation of Matter

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains a fundamental scientific law. Prompt: What does the law of conservation of matter mean in everyday terms?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions. Atoms rearrange, but the total mass remains constant. This principle is crucial in balancing equations and understanding material transformations.
