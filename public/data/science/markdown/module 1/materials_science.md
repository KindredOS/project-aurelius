## Ceramics

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces ceramic materials. Prompt: How are ceramics different from metals and plastics?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Ceramics are hard, brittle materials made by heating minerals. They resist heat and corrosion, making them ideal for cookware, tiles, and engines. Unlike metals, ceramics don’t conduct electricity well and can break easily.

## Composites

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores materials made from multiple substances. Prompt: Why combine materials instead of using just one?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Composites blend two or more materials to create a stronger or more useful product. Examples include fiberglass and carbon fiber. These materials combine the best properties of each component.

## Insulators and Conductors

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section compares how materials handle heat and electricity. Prompt: What keeps your house warm and your electronics safe?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Conductors allow heat or electricity to flow easily (like copper or aluminum). Insulators block flow (like rubber or glass). Choosing the right one is key for safety and efficiency in electronics and construction.

## Strength and Flexibility

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section dives into how materials resist force and bend. Prompt: When do you want something strong vs. something flexible?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Some materials resist breaking (strength), others bend without breaking (flexibility). Bridges need strong steel; backpacks need flexible fabric. Engineers test these properties when designing products.
