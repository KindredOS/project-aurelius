## Forms of Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the major types of energy and how they impact systems. Prompt: What are different forms of energy, and how do they affect the world around us?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. It exists in many forms—some visible, others hidden in motion or matter. Understanding energy types helps us recognize how systems function and interact, from a rolling ball to a lightning storm.

## Kinetic Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section defines energy in motion. Prompt: What happens to energy when something moves faster or heavier?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The faster or more massive an object, the more kinetic energy it has. It depends on both mass and velocity, and increases rapidly as speed increases.

## Potential Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces stored energy. Prompt: How can something have energy even if it isn’t moving?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Potential energy is stored energy due to an object’s position or condition. Gravitational potential energy depends on height and mass, while elastic potential energy comes from stretching or compressing materials like springs or rubber bands.

## Thermal Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores heat energy and particle motion. Prompt: Why do hot things feel warm, and how is energy involved?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Thermal energy is related to the movement of particles within a substance. The faster the particles move, the hotter the object feels. Temperature measures thermal energy, and it transfers through conduction, convection, or radiation.

## Light Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores energy that travels in waves. Prompt: How does light help us see, and where does it come from?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Light energy (or radiant energy) travels in waves and allows us to see. It comes from sources like the sun, light bulbs, and lasers. Light behaves as both a wave and particle and can reflect, refract, or be absorbed.

## Sound Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how vibrations create energy we can hear. Prompt: How do vibrations in air become sound in your ears?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Sound energy is produced by vibrating objects and travels as waves through matter. These waves move through air, water, or solids and are detected by our ears. Pitch and volume depend on the frequency and amplitude of the waves.

## Chemical Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores energy stored in matter. Prompt: How do batteries or food release energy?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between atoms. When bonds break or form during chemical reactions—like digestion or burning—energy is released or absorbed. Batteries, fuels, and food all store chemical energy.

## Electrical Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the energy of moving charges. Prompt: How does flipping a switch make lights turn on?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Electrical energy is caused by moving electrons. It flows through conductors in circuits and powers lights, machines, and more. Switches control the flow, and electricity can be generated from other energy sources like wind or solar.

## Nuclear Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers energy from atomic nuclei. Prompt: How does splitting or fusing atoms create powerful energy?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Nuclear energy comes from changes in the nucleus of atoms. Fission splits atoms (used in power plants), while fusion joins them (like in the sun). These processes release huge amounts of energy and are both powerful and complex.

## Energy Transformation

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how energy changes form. Prompt: What happens when energy shifts from one form to another?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Energy often changes form—chemical to thermal, or kinetic to sound. For example, in a toaster, electrical energy becomes thermal. No energy is lost, only transformed, although some becomes less useful (like heat loss).

## Law of Conservation of Energy

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section presents a core principle of physics. Prompt: Can energy ever disappear?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed—only transformed or transferred. This means the total energy in a closed system stays constant, though its form may change.

## Energy in Everyday Life

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section ties energy concepts to real-world use. Prompt: How do we use different forms of energy in our daily routines?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

From eating breakfast to charging a phone or riding a bike, we constantly use energy. Understanding how forms of energy interact and change helps us make better choices, conserve resources, and innovate smarter solutions.
