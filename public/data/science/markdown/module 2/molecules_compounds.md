## What Are Molecules?

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section defines molecules as combinations of atoms. Prompt: How do atoms come together to form molecules?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Molecules are formed when two or more atoms bond together. These combinations can be of the same or different elements, and their structure determines their properties and reactivity.

## Types of Chemical Bonds

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces ionic and covalent bonding. Prompt: What’s the difference between ionic and covalent bonds?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

In ionic bonds, electrons are transferred between atoms, typically between metals and non-metals. Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons, often between non-metals. These bonding types determine molecular stability and behavior.

## Forming Compounds

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses how elements combine to create compounds. Prompt: What distinguishes a compound from a mixture?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A compound is a substance formed from two or more elements bonded in fixed ratios, such as water (H₂O). In contrast, mixtures combine substances without chemical bonds, like salt in water.

## Molecular Structure

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how the shape of a molecule affects its properties. Prompt: Why is the geometry of a molecule important?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The three-dimensional shape of a molecule—determined by the arrangement of atoms and bond angles—affects polarity, reactivity, and physical properties like boiling point or solubility.

## Intermolecular Forces

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes forces between molecules. Prompt: How do intermolecular forces influence states of matter and physical changes?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Intermolecular forces—like hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and dispersion forces—affect how molecules attract or repel each other. These forces explain boiling points, melting points, and solubility.

## Naming Compounds

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces basic chemical nomenclature. Prompt: How do we name compounds using rules for ionic and covalent substances?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Naming compounds involves systematic rules based on element types and ratios. Ionic compounds use metal-nonmetal names (e.g., sodium chloride), while covalent compounds use prefixes to indicate quantity (e.g., carbon dioxide).
