## Introduction to Chemical Reactions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces chemical reactions and how substances transform. Prompt: What is a chemical reaction and how is it different from a physical change?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

A chemical reaction occurs when substances are transformed into new substances with different properties. Unlike physical changes, chemical reactions involve changes in the arrangement of atoms and the formation or breaking of chemical bonds.

## Types of Chemical Reactions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section outlines major categories of chemical reactions. Prompt: What are some common types of chemical reactions and how do they differ?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Key types include synthesis (combining substances), decomposition (breaking down), combustion (reacting with oxygen), single and double replacement reactions, and acid-base reactions. Each follows specific patterns of reactants and products.

## Signs of a Chemical Reaction

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes observable indicators that a chemical reaction has taken place. Prompt: How can you tell a chemical reaction is occurring?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Common signs include color change, gas production, temperature change, light emission, and the formation of a precipitate. These indicators suggest that a chemical transformation is happening.

## Law of Conservation of Mass

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how mass is conserved during chemical reactions. Prompt: Why must chemical equations be balanced?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The Law of Conservation of Mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means the total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products, requiring equations to be balanced.

## Balancing Chemical Equations

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the technique of balancing equations. Prompt: How do you balance a chemical reaction, and why is it important?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Balancing involves adjusting coefficients to ensure the same number of each atom appears on both sides of the equation. It reflects the conservation of mass and ensures accurate representation of the reaction.

## Energy in Reactions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section discusses exothermic and endothermic processes. Prompt: What is the role of energy in chemical reactions?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Reactions either release energy (exothermic) or absorb energy (endothermic). Understanding energy flow is crucial for controlling reactions in real-world contexts like engines or biological systems.
