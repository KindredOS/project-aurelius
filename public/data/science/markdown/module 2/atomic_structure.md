## Introduction to Atomic Theory

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the concept of atoms as the building blocks of matter. Prompt: What is an atom, and why is it fundamental to chemistry?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Atoms are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element. They consist of a nucleus with protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. Understanding atoms is essential to understanding all chemical behavior.

## Subatomic Particles

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes the structure and function of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Prompt: How do subatomic particles define an atom's identity and behavior?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Protons determine an element’s identity, neutrons affect its mass, and electrons influence chemical reactivity. The number and arrangement of these particles affect how atoms bond and interact with other atoms.

## Atomic Number and Mass

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how atomic number and mass define elements. Prompt: How are the atomic number and atomic mass related to the periodic table?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom and determines its position on the periodic table. Atomic mass includes both protons and neutrons and can vary in isotopes.

## Isotopes and Ions

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores isotopes and charged atoms. Prompt: What are isotopes and ions, and how do they differ from neutral atoms?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Ions are atoms with a charge, created when electrons are gained or lost. These variations impact physical and chemical behavior.

## Electron Configuration

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how electrons are arranged in atoms. Prompt: Why does electron configuration matter for chemical bonding?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Electrons occupy specific energy levels or shells. The arrangement—especially of outer (valence) electrons—determines how atoms interact and bond. Patterns in configuration explain trends across the periodic table.

## Atomic Models and History

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section covers the evolution of atomic models. Prompt: How have our models of the atom changed over time?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

From Dalton’s indivisible particles to Bohr’s orbitals and the quantum mechanical model, our understanding of atomic structure has grown. Each model improved our ability to explain and predict chemical behavior.
