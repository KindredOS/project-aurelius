## States of Matter

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section introduces the four main states of matter. Prompt: What are the defining characteristics of solids, liquids, gases, and plasma?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Matter exists in different states based on temperature and pressure. Solids have fixed shape and volume; liquids have fixed volume but flow; gases expand to fill containers; and plasma consists of ionized particles found in stars and lightning.

## Particle Behavior in Each State

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section describes particle movement in different states. Prompt: How do particles behave differently in solids, liquids, and gases?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

In solids, particles vibrate in place. In liquids, they slide past one another. In gases, they move freely and rapidly. In plasma, particles are charged and move with high energy. These behaviors explain state properties.

## Physical vs. Chemical Changes

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section distinguishes between physical and chemical changes. Prompt: How can you tell if a change is physical or chemical?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Physical changes alter the form but not the composition of a substance—like melting or freezing. Chemical changes result in new substances with different properties—such as rusting or burning.

## Phase Changes

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores transitions between states of matter. Prompt: What happens to particles during melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, and sublimation?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Phase changes are physical processes where energy is added or removed. Melting, vaporization, and sublimation require energy input; freezing, condensation, and deposition release energy.

## Energy and State Changes

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explains how thermal energy affects states of matter. Prompt: How does energy influence phase changes?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Energy affects particle motion and spacing. Heating increases energy, causing expansion or change of state. Cooling reduces energy, bringing particles closer together. Energy changes are key to understanding matter behavior.

## Real-World Examples

\[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section applies state changes to everyday experiences. Prompt: Can you think of examples of phase changes you observe in daily life?
\[Prompt Wrap End]

Boiling water, freezing ice, dew forming on grass, and frost appearing on windows all involve phase transitions. Understanding these processes helps connect chemistry to observable phenomena.
