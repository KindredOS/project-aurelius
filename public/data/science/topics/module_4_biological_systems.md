## üåø Module 4: Biological Sciences - Life, Ecology, and Living Systems
### *(Science ‚Äì Life Science & Environmental Systems)*

---

### üåø Core Focus
**From microscopic cells to vast ecosystems, this module explores the systems of life that thrive on Earth.**  
Students examine biological structures, interactions among organisms, and the balance required for sustainable ecosystems across land, sea, and air.
