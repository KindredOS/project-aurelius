## üåå Module 3: Planetary & Space Sciences - Earth, Systems, and the Cosmos
### *(Science ‚Äì Earth & Space Systems)*

---

### üåå Core Focus
**From molecules to mountains, and atoms to asteroids, this module explores our planet as a system within a vast and dynamic universe.**  
Learners will investigate Earth's systems, its place in the solar system, and the larger structures of the universe, continuing the systems-of-systems approach.
