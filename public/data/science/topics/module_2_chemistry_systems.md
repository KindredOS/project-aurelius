## üî¨ Module 2: Chemistry Fundamentals - Molecules, Reactions, and Chemical Systems
### *(Science ‚Äì Chemistry Core Concepts)*

---

### üî¨ Core Focus
**From atoms to molecules, chemistry is the study of transformations within and between systems.**  
Students explore the fundamentals of chemistry through the lens of structure, interaction, and change, continuing the systems-of-systems thinking established in Module 1.
