## üåå Module 1: The Physical World - Atoms, Energy, and Systems of Systems
### *(Science ‚Äì Physics & Chemistry Fundamentals)*

---

### üî¨ Core Focus
**Everything is made of atoms and shaped by physical forces.**  
Introduce students to the foundational building blocks of matter and the core physical laws that govern the universe. Frame science as the study of systems interacting with other systems.
