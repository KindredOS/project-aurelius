# README: Building Adaptive Science Modules

This guide explains how to create an adaptive, generative markdown-based science learning thread using the AdaptiveTextbook component. Each section includes structured headers, focused prompts, and interactive markers to enable dynamic engagement.

## üìö Overview of the Process

1. **Identify Core Topics**\
   Start by outlining the major content themes (e.g., Scientific Method, Ethics, Communication).

2. **Create Structured Markdown**\
   For each topic:

   - Write a concise section header (##).
   - Add a `[Prompt Wrap Start]` block with the topic scope and a targeted prompt.
   - Include a 1‚Äì2 paragraph summary of the topic.
   - Close with `[interactive element]` to enable frontend UI hooks.

3. **Separate Content into Logical Modules**\
   Split related but distinct areas (e.g., Data Analysis vs. Scientific Communication) into separate markdown canvases.

4. **Use Consistent Format**\
   Maintain alignment across topics for parsing in the AdaptiveTextbook renderer.

5. **Optional Enhancements**\
   Add diagrams, reflection questions, or activity prompts in separate blocks for enrichment.

## üîß Prompt Library Template

Each section uses the following prompt scaffold:

```
## [Header Title]
[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section [describes the scope of the content]. Prompt: [insert question here]
[Prompt Wrap End]

[Content body ‚Äî 1 to 2 paragraphs max]

[interactive element]
```

## üìÅ Sample Section Structure

```
## What is Science?
[Prompt Wrap Start]
This section explores the nature and purpose of science as a discipline. Prompt: What is the purpose of scientific thinking and how is it different from belief or tradition?
[Prompt Wrap End]

Science is the systematic study of the natural world through observation and experimentation. It relies on testable and falsifiable ideas and promotes curiosity and skepticism.

[interactive element]
```

## üß† Core Modules Used So Far

1. What is Science?
2. Scientific Method
3. Branches of Science
4. Lab Safety & Research
5. Data Analysis
6. Scientific Communication
7. Ethics in Science
8. Research Methods

Each was structured in its own markdown canvas for modularity.

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

- This format is compatible with the `AdaptiveTextbook.jsx` component.
- Each header becomes an enhancement point for AI augmentation.
- `[Prompt Wrap]` guards ensure alignment with content goals.
- `[interactive element]` tags anchor tool insertion points.
